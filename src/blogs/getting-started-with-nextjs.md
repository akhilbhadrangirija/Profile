# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building full-stack web applications simple and efficient. In this blog post, we'll explore the fundamentals of Next.js and how to get started with your first project.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides features like:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Pre-renders pages on the server for better performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generates static HTML at build time
- **API Routes**: Built-in API endpoints for backend functionality
- **File-based Routing**: Automatic routing based on file structure
- **Hot Reloading**: Instant feedback during development

## Setting Up Your First Next.js Project

Creating a new Next.js project is straightforward:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app
cd my-nextjs-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new project with all the necessary dependencies and start the development server.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure looks like this:

```
my-nextjs-app/
├── pages/          # File-based routing
├── components/      # Reusable React components
├── styles/         # CSS files
├── public/         # Static assets
└── package.json
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is where you define your routes. Each file becomes a route:

- `pages/index.js` → `/`
- `pages/about.js` → `/about`
- `pages/blog/[id].js` → `/blog/1`, `/blog/2`, etc.

### 2. Components

Components are the building blocks of your application. You can create reusable components in the `components` directory:

```jsx
// components/Button.js
export default function Button({ children, onClick }) {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      className="btn">
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

### 3. Styling

Next.js supports various styling approaches:

- **CSS Modules**: Scoped CSS classes
- **Styled Components**: CSS-in-JS
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Global CSS**: Traditional CSS files

## Data Fetching

Next.js provides several methods for data fetching:

### getStaticProps (SSG)

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const posts = await data.json()

  return {
    props: { posts },
    revalidate: 60 // Revalidate every 60 seconds
  }
}
```

### getServerSideProps (SSR)

```jsx
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { id } = context.params
  const post = await fetchPost(id)

  return {
    props: { post }
  }
}
```

## Deployment

Next.js applications can be deployed to various platforms:

- **Vercel**: Zero-config deployment (recommended)
- **Netlify**: Static site hosting
- **AWS**: Cloud hosting
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment

## Best Practices

1. **Use TypeScript**: Add type safety to your project
2. **Implement SEO**: Use Next.js Head component for meta tags
3. **Optimize Images**: Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
4. **Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically splits your code
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Use tools like Lighthouse for performance audits

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. Its features like server-side rendering, static generation, and file-based routing make development efficient and enjoyable.
