# I Helped Build FAH Because Hiring Was Broken

_By Akhil Bhadran – July 27, 2025_

Startup hiring wasn’t supposed to be this painful.

I joined Nik early. _FoundersAreHiring_ wasn’t a product yet—it was a rough sketch he’d drawn between shipping sprints and founder chaos. We were a tiny team, doing what early-stage startups do best: building, shipping, and stretching ourselves thin. My focus? Systems, backend, product.

**Hiring? Not really in my job description.**

But when we started growing, it suddenly became all-consuming.

---

## The Pain That Sparked a Platform

I found myself knee-deep in resumes and “top talent” intros. I was talking to developers who sounded great on paper… but didn’t actually want to build. Or couldn’t. Or didn’t care.

The same issues kept showing up:

- **Impressive LinkedIn profiles, zero real signal**

- **Candidates who looked great—but didn’t align**

- **Wasted hours on interviews that never should’ve happened**

And that’s when it hit me: **Nik was right. Startup hiring is broken.**
Bloated job boards. Recruiters adding friction. Signals lost in noise. The tools weren’t built for speed or clarity—they were built for scale. And scale is the enemy when you're hiring for fit.

We weren’t looking for “the best resume.”
We were looking for **builders who care**. People who’d jump into the fire with us. And those people were getting buried.

## So We Built the Tool We Wish We Had

Nik had already started experimenting with what would become [FoundersAreHiring](https://foundersarehiring.com/). When he asked if I wanted in, it was an easy yes.

We didn’t want to build just another [startup job board](https://foundersarehiring.com/startup-job-board). We wanted to _fix the hiring experience_—for founders and for startup-ready candidates alike.

Because we’re both.

## What Makes FoundersAreHiring Different

### 🔗 **Founder–Candidate Connection, Not Gatekeeping**

Recruiters weren’t speeding us up—they were slowing us down. So we stripped them out.
On FAH, founders and candidates connect _directly_. No middlemen. No games.

It’s hiring the way it should be:
**Real conversations, faster decisions.**

---

### ✉️ **Curated Job Drops, Not Spam**

Instead of flooding inboxes with junk, we send **curated job drops weekly**.
Each one is crafted to connect high-signal candidates with startups that _actually match_.

Less noise. More fit. Better outcomes.

---

### 🎯 **Fit Over Fluff**

Most platforms treat culture fit like a buzzword. We treat it like the foundation.
We go beyond titles and talk about what really matters:

- The **tech stack**

- The **pace**

- How **decisions get made**

- What kind of team you're walking into

Because finding the right role isn’t about “Senior” vs “Staff.”
It’s about _alignment_, energy, and mission.

---

### 🧠 **Built-In Filters for Real Signal**

Copy-paste resumes? Low-effort apps? We’ve been there.

FAH filters out the noise _before_ it hits your inbox.
Smart filtering tools surface candidates who _actually care_, so you spend less time sorting—and more time hiring.

---

## Built by Founders. For Founders (and Builders).

I’ve sat on both sides of the table.

- As a developer looking for a **mission-driven startup**

- And as a founder trying to hire people who **give a damn**

[FoundersAreHiring](https://foundersarehiring.com/) is the tool we wish existed when we were scaling. So we built it—for us, and for you.

If you’re a **founder trying to hire builders**, or a **builder hunting for a high-agency, high-trust team**, you should try FAH.

We’re live. We’re improving every week. And we’d love your feedback.
