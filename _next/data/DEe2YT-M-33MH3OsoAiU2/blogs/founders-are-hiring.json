Back then, it was just a few of us: writing code, shipping fast, and wearing every hat possible. My job was product, backend, and systems. <strong>Hiring? Not really my lane.</strong></p>\n<p>Until suddenly, it was.</p>\n<p>We started growing. That meant hiring. I began reviewing resumes, hopping on screening calls, and trying to find people who could actually help us move faster—not just look good on paper. And over and over, I kept seeing the same things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Polished LinkedIn profiles with zero real signal</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>“Great” candidates who weren’t a fit at all</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hours wasted on interviews that should never have happened</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That pain made something click. <strong>Nik was right: the hiring stack was broken</strong>—bloated, noisy, and full of friction. The traditional job boards didn’t help. Recruiters added layers instead of removing them. We were spending too much time filtering noise, and not enough building our team.</p>\n<h2>So We Built <a href=\"https://foundersarehiring.com/\">FoundersAreHiring</a></h2>\n<p>Nik had already started experimenting with what would become <a href=\"https://foundersarehiring.com/\">FoundersAreHiring</a>. When he asked if I wanted to help build it, I didn’t need convincing. It was the exact tool we needed but couldn’t find anywhere else.</p>\n<p>We didn’t set out to build <em>just another job board</em>. We wanted to rethink the experience for both <strong>founders</strong> and <strong>builders</strong>—because we had been (and still are) both.</p>\n<h3>Here’s What We Focused On:</h3>\n<h4>1. <strong>Direct Connections</strong></h4>\n<p>We removed the noise. At <a href=\"https://foundersarehiring.com/\">FoundersAreHiring</a>, candidates and founders talk directly—no recruiters, no middle layers. That means faster decisions and real conversations.</p>\n<h4>2. <strong>Real Signal</strong></h4>\n<p>Instead of daily job spam, we send <strong>curated drops weekly</strong>. That’s fewer emails, but higher quality. Each drop is tailored to highlight high-signal candidates and compelling startup roles.</p>\n<h4>3. <strong>Fit Over Fluff</strong></h4>\n<p>You won’t find meaningless job titles or buzzword-heavy company blurbs here. <a href=\"https://foundersarehiring.com/\">FoundersAreHiring</a> highlights how startups <strong>actually work</strong>—the tech stack, the pace, the culture, and how decisions get made. These things matter way more than whether someone’s last job had “senior” in the title.</p>\n<h4>4. <strong>Smart Filtering</strong></h4>\n<p>Tired of copy-paste resumes and low-effort applications? So were we. That’s why we built in filtering tools to automatically block low-signal submissions—so your inbox only gets the good stuff.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I’ve been on both sides of the table:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>As a developer looking for <strong>a real team</strong>, not just a job</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And as a founder trying to hire people who <strong>actually care</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://foundersarehiring.com/\">FoundersAreHiring</a> is the platform we wish had existed when we started building. So we made it. And we’re still making it better.</p>\n<p>If you’re a <strong>founder looking to hire</strong>, or a <strong>builder looking for a high-agency role</strong>, give <a href=\"https://foundersarehiring.com/\">FoundersAreHiring</a> a try.\nWe’re live, and we’re improving every week.</p>\n<p><strong>→ <a href=\"https://foundersarehiring.com/\">Try FoundersAreHiring</a></strong>\nTell us what’s missing.
